# Distance_Measurement_Atmega32 
Distance Measurement System using HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor. 

The project is implemented via AVR atmega32 MCU with 8 MHz internal clock frequency.

Designed based on the layered architecture model as follows:

▪Application layer

▪HAL: LCD, HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic Sensor

▪MCAL: GPIO , ICU
